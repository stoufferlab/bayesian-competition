[![DOI](https://zenodo.org/badge/124013430.svg)](https://zenodo.org/badge/latestdoi/124013430)

Code to support the manuscript *Environmental context, parameter sensitivity, and structural sensitivity impact predictions of annual-plant coexistence* accepted at *Ecological Monographs* by Alba Cervantes-Loreto et al.

## Organization
The repository provides scripts to perform model fits in [code/fit_models](code/fit_models), to post process those results in [code](code/), and to generate all figures in [code/gen_figures](code/gen_figures). These are supported by additional utility functions defined predominantly in scripts found in [code/lib](code/lib/).

## Warranty
All code is provided "as is" and without warranty. If you know of more efficient or elegant ways of doing anything (of which there are likely many), please let us know via the [GitHub Issue](https://github.com/stoufferlab/bayesian-competition/issues) page.
